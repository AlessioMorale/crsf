## CRSF Working Group Specifications

This is the official CRSFWG repository for the CSRF protocol and extension RFCs.

### Goals

The CRSFWG aims at providing a series of authoritative specifications for the CRSF protocol and future extensions.

As of now, the first milestone is to provide a [accurate documentation](https://github.com/crsf-wg/crsf/wiki) of the existing implementations.
